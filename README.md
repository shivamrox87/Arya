## A Brief of the Prototype:
  <img width="4971" alt="Untitled (2)" src="https://github.com/shivamrox87/Arya/assets/68838902/5eca527d-194b-4854-85b7-1f2d26545179">
Our platform mission is to bring generations closer to their Vedic roots with an all-in-one platform for spiritual guidance. Many people today seek spiritual fulfillment and understanding Vedic text in their lives, but they often struggle to due to the complexity and accessibility.
Users can ask all their queries from-”Arya”, the world's first AI Acharya, who possesses deep insights from all the four Vedas and will offer them with in-depth solutions and services 24x7.
Users can engage in interactive chats, ask personalised questions, receive mantra explanations, and unlock the transformative power of Vedic knowledge in a simplified language.
  
## Tech Stack: 
   Python
   Azure Machine Learning Studio for Notebook
   Azure OpenAI for API
   
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
To access the bot, simply visit https://telegram.me/VedicAI_bot, the bot can take voice as input from the user, the user can also give their queries into text too. The bot is capable of giving responses in hindi also, the user needs to just click on a button for it. The bot can also understand multiple languages, but it can give the replies in hindi and english voice only (for now). 
  
## What I Learned:
   We learnt about how AI can be impactful for our spiritual and mental growth if we choose it wisely.
   For this prototype, we explored new technologies also, like eleven labs, OpenAI Whisper models, we also tried for llama index, but it was not helpful for our use case. 
   After building this from the scratch we believe that our core product will surely impact the users.
